business logic applied
can only order a maximum of 100 of one cupcake per order, but can order multiple
types of cupcakes per order

can only place an order at one store per order. If you need to order from two stores,
that's two orders

if flour gets below a certain amount at a store, tell customer can't order there,
supply shortage

maximum 500 cupcakes per order

if first order with first customer, can only order 100 cupcakes

can only have a maximum of 5 active orders running consecutively, can't stack too many orders,
too hard for stores to fill

1. What are we supposed to be logging?
2. Where do we keep the log, where do we keep our XML/JSON data?
3. Why is Logger from NLog doubling up on entries?
4. Is it ok to keep data in multiple files? ONe for each class etc?
5. Use logger as a global variable within Program.cs
