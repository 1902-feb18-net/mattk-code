What happens with request and response
ASP.NET Core
We have a sequence of middleware, and these are plugged in, in order, using .Use calls in
Startup.Configure
middleware is some kind of processing or handling logic that will insert itself in the processing of
the request

 request comes in to -> other middleware (e.g. exception-handling, static file serving, etc.)
 then next we have routing middleware
 and then we have MVC
 and then the response goes to routing middleware
 back through other middleware
 and then on to the client

controller/action selection
 Authorization filters
 Resource filters
 Exception filters
Model binding
Action filters (before)
Action method execution
Action filters (after)
Result filters (before)
Result execution (e.g. view rendering)
Result filters (after)


filters are applied to controllers/actions using attributes or globally in Startup.Configure

Razor markup is executed/rendered into HTML

[HttpPost]
[CheckModelState]
public ActionResult Create(Model m)
{
    return View(m);

}
