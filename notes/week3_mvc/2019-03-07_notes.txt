Fred's batch showcase for Project 3
Take some notes
Introduction first
Then explain what the project is
LIst of technologies
Show test coverage, also shows a build result bar graph
How do you get a project topic?
How do you get your project scope?
It sort of looked like the batch had two main groups to support Cloudverse
What is a velocity, 63/84 points

org scoped vs public scoped
how loosely coupled are the architectures
what level did you take devops and agile
how far did your devops pipeline go
sonarcloud analysis
what checks did you have in the devops pipeline to test or review the application
pair programming
was there any testing related to security?
what regulations did you try and get your application meet?
mention of HIPPA requirements

how did you do your code review
each piece of code should be already be tied to what it should be doing
the branches withint the tasks
code review on the pull requests
automated code review, static analysis of your code, run your tests, if the tests fail then stop the code
looking for security flaws, opportunies for sql injection, cross-site string attacks
throwing strings all over the place

next week Monday Project 1 is due, Thurs-Fri come up with teams and start making proposals for what
you want your Project 2 to be.



Razor markup
-> Razor expressions 
e.g. @Model.Name, @(new Data{Name = "<A>"}.Name)
the result of the C# expression is converted to string, HTML encoded and inserted onto the
HTML page -> &lt;A&gt;
<script>
---
---

Razor blocks
e.g. @{ var data = 5;}
runs code during view render.
doesn't inherently insert anything to HTML

control statements
@if @while @foreach @switch etc.
HTML inside these will be conditionally/repetitively inserted

directives 
@model <type-name>
makes the new strongly-typed

comments @* *@ removed at render time

tag helpers


HTML helpers to know..
DisplayFor
DisplayNameFor
EditorFor
TextBoxFor
ActionLink
DropdownListFor
BeginForm
(doesn't auto insert anti-forgery token)

tag helpers
a (anchor)
asp-action
asp-controller
asp-route
asp-route-(param name) gives value for route parameter
input tag helper
asp-for
select tag helper which also uses asp-for, asp-items
label which also uses asp-for
span asp-validation-for
form asp-action attribute

new { @class = "col-2-sm" }

XSRF
cross-site request forgery

                        req
my server                <-                client
        form ->
        POST <-

can get a malicious middle man <- counterfeit form from some other site
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]

Data Annotations
library used for both EF and ASP.NET for a slightly different purpose
these are attributes both EF and ASP.NET use for validation checks & other metadata

- Required
- MaxLength
- Range
- RegularExpression
- DataType, (ZipCode, EmailAddress, Phone, Password)
- Display(Name = )


DI (dependency injection)
in Startup.ConfigureServices

services.AddSingleton
one instance of the service for application lifetime
services.AddScoped and also 
services.AddDbContext
one instance for each HTTP request
the third lifetime, which is transient, and that is one instance per call

registering concrete implementation on interface type things is where dependency injection really helps

if (Configuration["useDB"])
... AddDbContext
... AddScope<IRepo, DbRepo>()
else
AddScoped<IRepo, Repo>()

with validation, ModelState will get filled with Errors if the incoming response values do not meet the
requirements of the Data Annotations
