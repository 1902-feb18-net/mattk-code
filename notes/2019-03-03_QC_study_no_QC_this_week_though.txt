possible questions for QC...

what is a RDBMS, what is it for
RDBMS stands for relational database management system
it consists of a management systems for relational databases, by relational database I mean databases
in which the entities are allowed to have relationships to each other via foreign key constraints
and the system enforces and manages those constraints. One example of this is if a product is in an order,
and the product changes it's price, then the system will update the order as well if the two are connected via
a foreign key constraint.

what is a table in a relational database
a table is a collection of data representing an entity, it is a single unit within the database schema
CREATE TABLE Movie.Movie (
	MovieId INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1, 1), 
	Title NVARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
	ReleaseDate DATETIME2 NOT NULL,
	DateModified DATETIME2 NOT NULL DEFAULT(GETDATE()) 
	CONSTRAINT U_Movie_Title_Date UNIQUE (Title, ReleaseDate),
	-- CONSTRAINT PK_blah PRIMARY KEY (col1, col2) -- (composite PK)
	CONSTRAINT CHK_DateNotTooEarly CHECK (ReleaseDate > '1900')
);

tables are lists of data for a specific entity within the schema
each table can have different attributes such as an Id or a Name, and these attributes have data types
the table attributes by in large determine what entity the particular table is representing

a row is a specific line within a table representing one instance of an entity
rows are created with INSERT INTO command
the row lists the values of all of the data attributes for that particular instance
adds an entity to the table

what is a column
a column within a table is all of the values of a particular data attribute for an entity within a table
one example is products that have a price, and the price may range from 0.50 to 500.00

what is a primary key
a primary key is often denoted by an underline
the primary key is one of the candidate keys that we choose to identify a row, there are often multiple choices of candidate key

the candidate key of a table is the minimal set of columns that every other column depends on
the values of any candidate key can uniquely
identify any rows 
there can be multiple candidate keys

any key of any kind with more than one column in it is a composite key

what is referential integrity
refers to the accuracy and consistency of data within a relationship
whenever a foreign key is referenced, it must reference a valid, existing primary key in
the parent table
referential integrity prevents a user from doing the following
1. adding records to a related table if there are no associated records in the primary table
2. changing values in a primary table that result in orphaned records in a related table
3. deleting records from a primary table if there are matching related records

non-atomic values are those that can be subdivided further, they are not single units, like an array of int
hard to read values, have to search through strings

update anomaly
- problem that arises from redundancy
- with redundant data, we might not update all copies
duplicate rows having the same address,
change address in one row, maybe not the other

deletion anomaly
- if we delete some data, we sometimes lose other data
delete a record that has a list of company 
phone numbers, but the phone numbers aren't 
stored elsewhere

insertion anomaly
- it becomes impossible to insert some data
without some associated data
can't add a new course unless we have at
least one student enrolled in a course

what is RDBMS multiplicity
1 to 1
N to 1
N to N

what is normalization dependency
full functional dependency equates to a database satisfying 2NF

before 1NF is all databases including unnormalized databases
1NF: first normal form
- no duplicate rows
- atomic values
- no repeating groups of columns
(e.g. Color 1, Color 2, Color 3)

2NF: second normal form
- 1NF
- no non-CK column may depend on PART of any composite CK
- no partial dependency

3NF:
- no non-candidate key column may depend on
any other non candidate key column
- no transitive dependcies or no indirect dependencies

what is a transitive dependency
a functional dependency that is one or more tables removed, so it is not a direct functional dependency

explain easier to evolve the data model

DML (data manipulation language)
work with tables and database
those commands are as follows: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE TABLE
what does truncate table do?
removes all rows from a table same as DELETE FROM Table WHERE 1=1;

DDL (data definition language)
get tables and database off the ground
those commands are as follows: CREATE, ALTER, DROP
and also JOINS

let's talk about all the different kinds of joins
Cross join does a cartesian product, so each row gets combined with every other row in the other table

INNER JOIN defaults to JOIN in SQL Server
INNER JOIN joins the two tables based on a condition, such as whereever an id from the left table matches an id column in the right table
join uses ON for the condition

joining on true is the same as a cross join

three kinds of outer join: left outer, right outer, and full outer

left join takes all rows in the left table, even if there are no matches, it will fill the not matching columns with null

right join takes all rows in the right table, even if there are no matches, it will fill the not matching columns with null

full outer join

a WHERE clause can also be applied to the joijn

tables can be aliased with an AS clause

a self join is a query in which a table is joined (compared) to itself

what are the set operations
what is a union set operation, it merges both tables, the elements don't have to be in both tables, eliminating duplicates, DISTINCT is the default for union, there is also an ALL version
what is an intersect operation, it takes what is common to both, eliminating duplicates

except gives values that are in the first but no the second result

WITH gives a subquery block a name referred to as common table expression

There are also available aggregate functions: avg, min, max, sum, count

What is a view
a view is like a pretend table, it's gives a specific query a name that you use often, and sort of treats it like a table, even though it isn't one
can do inserts/updates/deletes through a view

what are sql query functions

can DECLARE variables in SQL with @ symbol
can have FUNCTIONS
using AS
RETURNS
BEGIN
END

TRIGGERS run FUNCTIONS
with AFTER clause, like AFTER UPDATE, so after update, the trigger happens

can have TRY CATCH and RAISERROR commands within FUNCTIONS
can use PROCEDURE with EXECUTE command
