module is a unit of deployment within your app, but deployment is not really the right word
container/namespace for components/directives
pipes, etc.
can import such from other modules,
must export its own for others to see

app
root module
root component


routing module


module
class + NgModule decorator


The first thing that you do is bootstrap the root module which bootstraps the root component

A module is a class, we put a decorator on that class, it's like an attribute in C#
the class is TS and the NgModule is Ng

result rendering is an inherent part of the mvc lifecycle
part of http response
could be view, could be json, could be object that could become json, could be status code
