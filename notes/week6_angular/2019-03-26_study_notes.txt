cognizant questions...

stack is first in last out
queue is first in first out

BFS uses always a queue
DFS uses always a stack

BFS algorithm with a queue
Start at source vertex source, put s in the queue
Discover every vertex that is reachable from s
Also produces a BFS tree with root s and including all
reachable vertices
BFS calculates the shortest path distance to the source
vertex

DFS is another strategy for exploring a graph
Explore "deeper" in the graph whenever possible
Edges are explored out of the most recently discovered vertex
v that still has unexplored Edges
When all of v's edges have been explored, backtrack to the
vertex from which v was discovered
recursive

where are cognizant's offices?
where matt probably go?
maybe ohio, could be anywhere
what matt do?
FACETS, healthcare products,
TriZetto Healthcare products
What language is FACETS, what technologies does it use?

so I was a mechanical engineer working in a residual stress testing lab, a lot of attention to detail, started doing lab work, and 
moved on to more contour stress data analysis work, wanted to do something else, started an online CS degree program
got a degree in CS moved to Oregon, wanted to try something different, a little tired of California


project 1 was a cupcake store order manager in C#, .NET framework, using SQL Server hosted on Azure connecting to SQL Server database with
Entity framework, using ASP.NET MVC for the webpages

worked on a team for capstone project, graphical web crawler Python Flask, D3.js for the front end and graph
worked on a team someone else did they actual HTML scraper that parses the HTML and finds the links to build
the web crawler, I worked ont he front end UI and the graph itself in D3.js

working on project 2 C#, .NET framework, using SQL Server connecting to SQL SErver database with EntityFramework,
using ASP.NET MVC for the webpages, and we just added Angular. We have the DAL as a web service, that our ASP.NET MVC
can access that, just getting Angular. We have the application, both projects hosted through Azure, using Azure DevOps
for continuous deployment, also using the Kanban board on Azure DevOps a little bit
