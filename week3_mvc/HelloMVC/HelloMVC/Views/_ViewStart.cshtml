@* we do Views in ASP.NET MVC with CSHTML files
    that contain both "Razor syntax" and HTML.
    the Razor syntax is compiled when the view needs to be rendered into proper HTML
    razor comments look like this *@

@* below is a "Razor block", it switches us entirely into C# mode to have statements separated
    by semicolon, similar to embedded Ruby and other templating schemes*@

@{
    Layout = "_Layout";
}
